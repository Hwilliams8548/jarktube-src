<span class="highlight">Q: How can I share my videos and link to them from my website?</span>

<br><br>A: <a href="sharing.php">How to share and link to your videos</a>
<br/>
<br/>

<span class="highlight">Q: What kind of videos can I upload?</span>

<br><br>A: You may upload any kind of personal video that you'd like to share with the world. We don't allow any nudity and your video must be appropriate for all audiences. 
<br/>
<br/>
However, this still leaves a lot of room for creativity!! Do you own a <a href="results.php?search=dog">dog</a> or a <a href="results.php?search=cat">cat</a>? Have you gone on vacationing in <a href="results.php?search=mexico">Mexico</a>? Do you live in <a href="results.php?search=netherlands">The Netherlands</a>?
<br/>
<br/>
These are just some examples of the videos that our users are uploading. In the end, you know yourself best. What would <i>you</i> like to capture on video?

<br><br><span class="highlight">Q: How long can my video be?</span>

<br><br>A: There is no time limit on your video, but the video file you upload must be less than 100 MB in size.

<br><br><span class="highlight">Q: What video file formats can I upload?</span>

<br><br>A: JarkTube use ffmpeg, a piece of software with can deal with most file formats and convert them to mp4. So, also every format works.

<br><br><span class="highlight">Q: How can I improve my videos?</span>

<br><br>A: We encourage you to edit your videos with software such as Windows Movie Maker (included with copies of Windows ME, XP, Vista, and Windows Live Essentials), or Sony Vegas (I prefer 8 or 11, but they are not required). Using these programs you can easily edit
your videos, add soundtracks, etc.

<br><br><span class="highlight">Q: Do I retain copyrights and other legal rights to my videos?</span>

<br><br>A: I really don't know about copyright yet. I will think about it.

<br><br><span class="highlight">Q: What is your policy on copyright infringement?</span>

<br><br>A: There isn't any yet, but still don't go breaking copyright law becauase you and succulent64 (the creator) will get in big trouble for this.

<br><br><span class="highlight">Q: How do I report copyright infringement?</span>

<br><br>A: If you believe that someone else has uploaded your copyrighted content without your permission, we encourage you to contact that person in order to resolve any differences with them directly.

<br><br><span class="highlight">Q: What if I have been falsely accused of copyright infringement?</span>

<br><br>A: We'll let you know if we receive a copyright complaint about any of your video content that is hosted on JarkTube. We'll give you the opportunity to respond appropriately.<br>

<br><span class="highlight">Q: What are you doing to prevent content that violates your policies from appearing in JarkTube?</span>

<br><br>A: We do a preliminary review on uploaded videos through both a manual and automated process. Although we try our best to detect and remove videos that violate our policy guidelines, our review process is primarily focused on removing adult content or obvious copyright violations, and is not bulletproof. However, we encourage our viewers to notify us when they discover policy violations or copyright issues -- we have a process for reviewing reported policy violations, and respond to reported copyright violations under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.

<br><span class="highlight">Q: What is this .veg or .mswmm file?</span>

<br><br>A: A .MSWMM file is a Windows Movie Maker Project file and a .VEG file is a Sony Vegas Project file. You need to export or render the movie to upload it to JarkTube.
