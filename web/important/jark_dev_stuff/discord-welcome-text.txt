Hello and thanks for joining JarkTube from the advertisements in SubRocks or Vidlii

JarkTube is an YouTube Hitchhiker (YouTube 2012-2017) revival, an successor to NoobTube, and overall an shitty website.

Yes, I know FulpTube did this, but it died so ...

Website (beta):    
                                                                        
http://jark.succulent64.ml (might limit this to ngrok tunnels)

Why:
I made this as NoobTube shut down to to XSS and stuff

Also, I counted vote for which layout people wanted the most and 2013 won.

JarkTube is no affiliated at all with YouTube or any of the other OIC YouTube sites.
