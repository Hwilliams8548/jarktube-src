How to calculate the width of likes and dislikes by succulent64:

Um you multiply 100 by likes divided by likes plus dislikes. You get the width of likes.

For dislikes, you do the same thing, but switch the first call of likes with dislikes.

Basicly, you multiply 100 by dislikes divided by likes plus dislikes. You then get the width of dislikes.

Here's this in calculator form:

I'm very dumb, so math symbols

/ is division

* is multiplcation

likes width (j) = 100 * (likes / (likes + dislikes))
 
dislikes width (l) = 100 * (dislikes / (likes + dislikes))
 
Now, here's this in PHP form:

<?php echo 100 * (1 / (0 + 1)); ?>
